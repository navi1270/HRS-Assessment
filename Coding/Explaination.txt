To perfect this assessment I have taken help from the internet. Here is the step by step guide for this particular task:

1. Setup AWS Credentials:

Make sure to configure AWS credentials configured with AWS CLI configuration

2. Install Dependencies:

Install 'boto3' package using 'pip':
- pip install boto3

3. Configure IAM Role:

Need to make sure that IAM role used by EC2 instance or Lambda function executing this script has permissions to interact with ElastiCache and S3.


Explaination of Approach:

Boto3 Usage: We utilize Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, as it provides a convenient and Pythonic way to interact with AWS services programmatically.

Modular Code: The script is modular and follows best practices such as defining a function (export_to_s3) for exporting data, which enhances reusability and maintainability.

Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented. However, in a production setting, I should have included more robust error handling and logging mechanisms to handle failures gracefully and troubleshoot issues effectively.

Parameterized Inputs: The script accepts parameters such as Redis endpoint, S3 bucket, S3 key, and export format, making it flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.

Data Formats: It supports exporting data in JSON or CSV format, which are common formats suitable for analytics processing.
